# These notes are hopelessly sketchy at the moment. 
#
# (1) Edit electionConf.pm 
#     (i.e. set appropriate values for your ballot)
# (2) Run "make election" or ./genElection.sh 
#     (i.e. create the necessary PHP files + stub SQL)
#
# Running make with no target will provide some documentation
